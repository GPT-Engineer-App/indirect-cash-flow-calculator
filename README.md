# indirect-cash-flow-calculator

Prepare an indirect cash flow statement for [Company Name] for the year ending [Date].
Data Inputs:
â€¢	Income statement for [Company Name] for the year ending [Date].
â€¢	Balance sheet for [Company Name] at the beginning and end of the year ending [Date].
Calculation Steps:
1.	Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 
o	Start with Net Income from the income statement.
o	Adjust for non-cash expenses: Add Depreciation, Amortization, and any other non-cash expenses included in the income statement.
o	Adjust for changes in working capital: 
ï‚§	Add Decrease in Accounts Receivable (a decrease in receivables means cash was collected).
ï‚§	Subtract Increase in Accounts Receivable (an increase means less cash was collected).
ï‚§	Add Increase in Inventory (an increase means less cash was spent on purchases).
ï‚§	Subtract Decrease in Inventory (a decrease means more cash was spent on purchases).
ï‚§	Add Increase in Accounts Payable (an increase means more cash is available to pay suppliers later).
ï‚§	Subtract Decrease in Accounts Payable (a decrease means less cash is available to pay suppliers later).
2.	Cash Flow from Investing Activities: 
o	Identify cash inflows from the sale of property, plant, and equipment (PPE) or other investments.
o	Identify cash outflows for the purchase of PPE or other investments.
o	Calculate the net cash flow from investing activities (inflows minus outflows).
3.	Cash Flow from Financing Activities: 
o	Identify cash inflows from issuing new common stock.
o	Identify cash outflows for repurchasing common stock or paying dividends.
o	Identify cash inflows from issuing new debt.
o	Identify cash outflows for repayments of principal on existing debt.
o	Calculate the net cash flow from financing activities (inflows minus outflows).
4.	Net Cash Flow: 
o	Sum the cash flow from operating activities, cash flow from investing activities, and cash flow from financing activities.
Presentation:
â€¢	Present the cash flow statement in a clear and concise format, categorized by operating, investing, and financing activities.
â€¢	Include a clear explanation of any significant adjustments made to net income.
Additional Considerations:
â€¢	You may encounter other non-cash items in the income statement or balance sheet that require adjustments. Research the appropriate treatment for these items.
â€¢	Double-check your calculations for accuracy.
Software:
â€¢	Spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets can be used to automate these calculations.
